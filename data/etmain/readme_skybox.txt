This mini-mid gives venice a new sky.

Skybox made by Avoc @ eft-clan.com

------------------------------------------

If you use a changed mapscript for Venice, you have to add the following into the mapscript, otherwise it won't work.

remapshader "textures/skies_c1/co_venicesky"	"textures/turbulent_blue/turbulent_sky"
remapshaderflush


Please take a look into "maps/venice.script" of this pk3 if you don't know how to do it.


Please note that I had to rename the textures, folder and shader of the skybox, because there was not fitting exactly into the map and to prevent problems with other maps.
If you want to use the skybox in your own map or mod, please download the original content here:
