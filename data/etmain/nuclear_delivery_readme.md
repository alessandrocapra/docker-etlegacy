Map Description:
In Nuclear Delivery, the Allies must infiltrate the Axis bunkers, construct the door controls, steal the dynamites and escort the truck through enemy territory to a military base.
However, the Axis have set up defenses to stop the mission.
The Allies must first construct the bridge to allow the truck to cross the river, construct the Command Post and destroy the barricade blocking the final path.
Once the truck reaches its final destination, the nuclear launch sequence begins. 
The Axis can interrupt the launch by pressing the abort button or destroying the generator, forcing the Allies to repair it before trying again.

This map is a remake of the classic ETL SP Delivery, bringing new mechanics, objectives, and nuclear destruction. Will the Allies succeed in launching the missile, or will the Axis stop the nuclear strike?

IMPORTANT: HunkAllocate Error Fix for ET 2.6b users (with default com_hunkmegs settings 56)

Some players using Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory 2.6b may experience a Hunk_AllocateTempMemory error when loading Nuclear Delivery B2. This happens when the game's memory allocation is too low for large maps.  

How to Fix the Issue:  
1. Open the console (~) in ET before joining the server.  
2. Type: `/com_hunkmegs 128` and press Enter.  
3. Restart your game and try loading the map again.  

Alternatively, you can use ETLegacy, which automatically handles memory limits better and improves overall performance. Download it here: https://www.etlegacy.com
