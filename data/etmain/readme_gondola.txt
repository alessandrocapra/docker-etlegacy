zzz_venice_gondola.pk3 - a small mini-mod by IndyJones for Wolfenstein ET. It replaces the Venice Speedboat with a traditional Venetian rowing boat - Gondola. The PK3 includes changed command map icon, and removed engine start/stop sounds. You will probably notice a new music while escorting it... but it's not my "fault". It was always there, but it was silenced due to loud engine sound.

Feel free to use it on your server.
Cheers, IndyJones
